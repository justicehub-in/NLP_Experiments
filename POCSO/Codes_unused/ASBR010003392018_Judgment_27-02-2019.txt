JUDGMENT
1. The prosecution case, in brief, is that, on 12.05.2016 one Haidar Ali lodged an FIR in Kalgachia P.S. alleging inter alia that on 10.05.16 at about 11 am his 16 years old daughter disappeared from his residence, but after a discrete search one Manowara Khatun informed on 11-05-16 that her husband Mojibar Rahman kidnapped her. Hence the case.
2. Acting on the information police got a case registered being Kalgachia P.S. case No. 403/16 u/s 366(A) IPC and investigated the case.
3. On completion of investigation, police finally laid the charge sheet against accused Mofizur Rahman u/s 366(A) IPC and section 4 of POCSO Act with a view to stand trial.
4. In due course, when accused entered his appearance in court vide order dated 10-05-18 all the particulars relating to the case were furnished with accused. Thereafter, having heard the learned counsel and on perusal of the record having found a prima facie case charge u/s 4 of POCSO Act2 was framed. The substance of the offence on being read over and explained accused pleaded not guilty and claim trial.
5.
During the course of trial, the prosecution examined 6 witnesses
namely Dr. Anima Boro as PW-1, Sahidul Islam as PW-2, Afjal Hussain
Choudhury as PW-3, Guljar Choudhury as PW-4, Makmida Khatun as PW-5
and Tarun Chandra Boro as PW-6.
6.
Hearing to the learned Addl. P.P. further prosecution evidence stands
closed.
7.
Examination of accused u/s 313 Cr.P.C. is also dispensed with in view
of lack of implicating materials. The plea of the accused is total denial of the
prosecution case. As such, on being asked accused declined to adduce
defence evidence.
8.
Now point for determination
;-
.1. Whether on 10.05.2016 at about 11 pm accused committed
penetrative sexual assault on the victim girl as alleged ?
9.
Discussion, Decision and reasons for such decision :-
I have heard the learned lawyers appearing for both sides and also
carefully scanned the prosecution evidence available on record.
10.
The learned counsel appearing for the State Smti. P. Das submitted
that though the prosecution examined 6 witnesses but the court may pass
judgment after assessment of evidence.
11.
On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the accused
person vehemently contended that there is absolutely nothing in the
evidence of the prosecution witnesses which constitute the ingredients of
the offences u/s 4 of POCSO Act. According to the learned defence counsel,
the prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt of accused for sustaining
conviction for the offence u/s 4 of POCSO Act. As such, the learned counsel
prays to acquit the accused person.
12.
In the context of the submission of the learned counsel appearing for
both sides it would be in the fitness of things to refer to section 4 as defined
in the POCSO Act 2012.
“4. Punishment for penetrative sexual assault. - Whoever
commits penetrative sexual assault shall be punished with imprisonment of
either description for a term which shall not be less then 7 years but which
may extend to imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.”3
13.
Now, on perusal of the offence u/s 4 of POCSO Act and having heard
the learned counsels appearing for both sides and on careful perusal of the
evidence available on record particularly the evidence of the alleged victim
it transpires that she is unable to speak anything about the incident not to
speak of commission of the penetrative sexual assault against her. From her
evidence nothing can even be inferred even remotely that it was the
accused who committed the offence u/s 4 of POCSO Act.
14.
In her statement u/s 164 Cr.P.C. also (Exhibit 2) she has not stated
anything regarding any sexual assault on her by accused person. The
medical officer PW-1 on examination of the victim also found no evidence of
any penetrative sexual assault on the victim. The evidence of PW-2, PW-3 &
PW-4 also not supporting the prosecution case in any manner. The evidence
of alleged victim also does not inspire any confidence in the mind of the
court regarding commission of the alleged offence by accused person. Form
the evidence on record it transpires that the prosecution fail to establish
the age of the alleged victim girl also by way of proving her date of birth or
by way of any other credible manner. In the absence of any such
documentary proof no inference can be drawn that the girl was minor at the
relevant time. There is absolutely no evidence on behalf of the prosecution
to show that any offence u/s 4 of POCSO Act has been committed by
accused. In fact, no ingredients of section 4 of POCSO Act have been found
established.
15.
In the result, this court has no option but to acquit the accused
Mofizur Rahman from the charges u/s 4 of POCSO Act on the ground of
benefit of doubt and set him at liberty forthwith.
16.
The terms of bail bond of accused is extended for a period of 6 (six)
months from to-day as provided U/S 437(A) of Cr.P.C.
17.
Let a copy of the judgment be forwarded to the learned District
Magistrate, Barpeta as provided in section 365 Cr.P.C.
18.Let case record be consigned to record room as per procedure.
19.Given under my hand and seal of this Court on 27th day of February,
2019, at Barpeta.
